42 School Projects
Welcome to my 42 School Projects repository! ðŸ‘‹

About
I am a student at 42 School, a renowned programming school that offers an innovative, peer-to-peer learning environment. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions and approaches to the various projects and exercises undertaken during my time at 42.

Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to document my journey through the projects at 42 School. Here, you will find my unique solutions, thought processes, and methodologies. While these solutions are tailored to my understanding and interpretation of the project requirements, they may not necessarily be the only or the best solutions.

Projects
Each project is organized into its own directory, containing:

Project Description: A brief summary of the project's objectives and requirements.
Solution: My approach and code to solve the project.
Notes: Any additional notes, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
Disclaimer
The code and solutions presented in this repository are for educational and personal reference purposes only. Please be aware that copying code without understanding it can undermine your learning process. I encourage you to use this repository as a guide, but always strive to write your own code and find your own solutions.

Contributions
This repository is a personal journal of my learning experience, and as such, contributions are not accepted. However, I am always open to constructive feedback and suggestions! Feel free to reach out via issues or email if you have any thoughts to share.
